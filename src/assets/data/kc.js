        question: "What is Cancer?",
        answer:
          "Cancer is a disease which starts when there is a damage to the genes of one or more cells of the body, leading the cell to grow out of control, crowd out normal cells, and keep the normal cells from doing what they are normally supposed to do. Cells are the building blocks of our body and every organ in our body is made up of millions of them. Genes are pieces of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that are present inside every cell and contains information on how that cell should function. Some of these contain information on how that particular cell should grow and divide. Their damage leads to the initiation of cancer.",
      },
      {
        question: "What causes cancer?",
        answer:
          "There is no single causative agent for cancer, a number of causes have been identified. These range from certain lifestyle habits, genes that are inherited from parents, and being exposed to other cancerous agents. All of these can affect how and when cancer might start. They damage the genes in cells, which can sometimes lead to cancer. The cause vary with different cancers but many times, there is no known cause for a cancer.People can help reduce their risk of getting cancer by staying away from tobacco, staying at a healthy weight, eating healthy, being active, avoiding or limiting alcohol, and protecting their skin from the sun. However, there are things that increase a person’s risk of cancer that they cannot control, like the genes they get from their parents and changes in cells that happen as a person gets older.",
      },
      {
        question: "Where can cancer start?",
        answer:
          "Cancer cells can form anywhere in the body, including organs, muscles, bones, and blood. Cancer is usually named for the part of the body or type of cell where it began. For example, cancer that starts in the breast is called breast cancer. Even if it spreads to other parts of the body, it is still called breast cancer. Being able to spread to other parts of the body makes cancer cells different from normal cells. This spread is called metastasis. These cancer cells can end up in the lymph nodes or other body organs, causing problems with normal body functions and leading the destination organ to malfunction. Some types of cancer grow and spread fast. Others grow more slowly. Some are more likely to spread to other parts of the body. Others tend to stay where they started and don’t spread.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is a tumor?",
        answer:
          "A tumor is a group of many cells that bunch together. Some tumors are cancer, meaning they have cancer cells in them. But many tumors are not cancer. Tumors that are not cancer are called benign. Tumors that are cancer are called malignant. Some cancers don’t start as tumors but happen because of damage to cells in the blood. These damaged cells can cause cancers such as leukaemia, myeloma, and lymphoma.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is metastasis?",
        answer:
          "It means that the cancer cells have spread to a different part of your body than where it started. This happens often by the means of blood stream or lymphatic system. It is generally seen in very late\u002Dstage cancers.",
      },
      {
        question: "How is cancer found?",
        answer:
          "Most of the cancers in their early stages are imperceptible and produce vague symptoms. Cancer is found when a person has symptoms that don’t go away. Other cancers are found when a person gets regular screening tests. Screening can help find cancers before a person develops symptoms i.e., when cancers are smaller and easier to treat.",
      },
      {
        question: "What does the stage of a cancer mean?",
        answer:
          "For most cancers, its stage is based on the size, if it has grown out of where it started, and if it has spread to other parts of the body. Most of them are given a stage from 1 to 4, with Stage 1 being the one where the cancer has not spread beyond the organ of origin and Stage 4 means it has spread to other parts of the body. In some cases, a Stage 0 is also defined which means that the damaged cells are still only in the layer of cells where it has started. Stage 0 cells are not cancer but could become cancer because they are damaged. The stage of cancer helps doctors in determining the best course of treatment.",
      },
      {
        question: "How is cancer Treated?",
        answer:
          "Many types of cancer can be treated successfully. Common treatments for cancer are surgery, medicines, and radiation. Sometimes more than one type of treatment is used, depending on the type and stage of cancer. Each person’s treatment is based on the type and stage of their cancer. The cancer care team looks at where the cancer started, how big it is, if it has spread, and all test results. A person’s age and other health problems might affect treatment choices, too. When the cancer care team has the information they need, they look at treatment guidelines from experts to see what is most likely to work.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is Cancer Surgery?",
        answer:
          "Surgery is used to remove part or all of a cancer. Surgery may be the only treatment needed if a cancer is very early or just confined to one place, or it may be used along with other treatments.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can Cancer be treated with medicines?",
        answer:
          "Many times, medicines are used to kill cancer cells or slow down their growth. Some of these medicines are given through an injection or can be taken orally like a pill. Most of the times, more than one medicines are used together to treat a cancer. These medication work throughout your body and not just in one place. The different medications used are chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and hormone therapy",
      },
      {
        question: "How is cancer treated with radiation?",
        answer:
          "Radiation is used to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells in one area of the body. It is like getting an X\u002Dray but the dose is much higher than a regular X\u002Dray. Other times it is given by putting a radioactive source inside or close to the tumor to give off the radiation.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does the treatment of cancer last?",
        answer:
          "The duration of treatment depends on the stage at which it is diagnosed. With short and easy treatment modalities for early cancers to lifelong treatment duration for Stage 4 cancers. In general, 3 \u002D 6 months is the total duration of treatment for most of the cancers. But after the completion of treatment, you should undergo lifelong surveillance to keep a check on recurrence of cancer.",

        question: "What is cancer screening?",
        answer:
          "Cancer Screening is a way in which cancer is detected before you have any symptoms. It also involves looking for areas that can turn into cancer, or “pre\u002Dcancers”. The goal of screening is to find pre\u002Dcancers and cancers as early as possible, so that the treatment is easier and have the best possible outcome.",
      },
      {
        question: "How is cancer screening done?",
        answer:
          "Different tests can be used to screen for different types of cancers. The age at which screening starts depends on the type of cancer being screened for. This is because different cancers strike at different times in a person’s life.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why should I have cancer Screening?",
        answer:
          "Cancer that is found early often is small and can be cured or treated easily. Treating certain cancers will help you live longer. It also helps in picking up signs of “pre\u002Dcancers” i.e., cells that might become cancerous. Early detection of these cancers decreases the duration of treatment, leads to reduction of costs and also decreases the mental and physical trauma of the person undergoing the treatment.",
      },
      {
        question: "When should I start screening for cancer?",
        answer:
          "Different cancers tend to develop at different age groups and there are various recommendations and studies that have validated this. The risk of developing cancer increases with age, and the timing to start screening for an average risk person is defined. In some cases, the screening might start at a younger age specifically in people with a family history.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Does an abnormal screening test result mean that I have cancer?",
        answer:
          "An abnormal screening test result doesn't necessarily means that you have cancer or pre\u002Dcancer. If the test is abnormal, then you might need to either get other tests or to get the test repeated after sometime to definitely say that you have cancer. Try not to worry about having cancer until you follow up with a healthcare professional.",

        question:
          "Should I get tested for breast cancer if I don’t have any symptoms?",
        answer:
          "After a certain age, everyone should enrol in a breast cancer screening programme which helps in detecting breast cancer before it is large enough to produce symptoms. You might need to start screening early in some cases,i.e., if you have a family history of gene mutations putting you at an increased risk for breast cancer.",

        question: "What are the types of Breast Cancer?",
        answer:
          "There are several types and subtypes of breast cancer, they are treated similarly with few exceptions. It is divided broadly into two categories, In situ Breast cancer and Invasive Breast Cancer.In situ Breast Cancer \u002D These are the earliest breast cancers i.e., when the cancer has just started to form and has not spread beyond the tissue of origin. But these may spread and progress to Invasive cancer if not Treated.Invasive Breast Cancer \u002D The majority of breast cancers are invasive Breast Cancers because they have grown or “invaded” beyond the ducts or lobules of the breast into the surrounding tissue.",

      {
        question: "What are locally advanced and inflammatory Breast cancer?",
        answer:
          'Although not precisely defined, the term "locally advanced" implies one or more of the following: a tumor larger than 5 cm (about 2 inches), many palpable positive surrounding lymph nodes, cancer nodules or ulceration in the skin overlying the breast, or fixation of the cancer to the chest wall behind the breast. Another form of locally advanced breast cancer is "inflammatory breast cancer," which causes swelling, redness, or thickening of the skin due to its invasion by cancer cells. The likelihood of curing locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancer is lower than for smaller cancers and cancers that do not have any of these physical findings but is still possible with appropriate treatment.',

          "Different experts have different recommendations for breast cancer screening. Also, the recommendations for screening might be different for people at higher risk of developing breast cancer.In general, you should start screening for breast cancer as early as 40 \u002D 45 years of age. If you are under 40 but have a relative who got breast cancer at a young age, or if you have certain genes that increase your risk of breast cancer (e.g., BRCA genes) then you should consult a breast care specialist to start screening earlier.",

        question:
          "Is there any drawback of getting screening done for Breast Cancer?",
        answer:
          "False positives \u002D Sometimes mammograms give “False\u002Dpositive” results. This means the results suggest that you might have cancer when you actually do not. This leads to more tests (like biopsy) to know for sure whether the result is cancer.Radiation Exposure \u002D Like all X\u002Drays, mammograms expose you to some radiation. The amount of radiation used for mammogram is quite low and is very unlikely to cause any harm. On the flipside, the advantages of detecting cancer early greatly outweighs the small risk of radiation exposure.",

        answer:
          "Before the mammogram, you will be asked to undress from the waist up and put on a gown. To make the breast tissue easier to see, a nurse or technician will flatten each breast between two plastic panels. Then your breasts will be X\u002Drayed 1 at a time. For the purpose of screening each breast is X\u002Drayed twice, once from the top and once from side to side.",

          "On the day of your mammogram, it is advisable to have a light breakfast. Wear a dress where it is easier to take off the top easily. Avoid wearing deodorants, talcum powder or lotion as these may be picked up on the mammogram to give false positive results. If you are still wearing these then ask the nurse to provide you with a wet wipe to clean the area around the breast and the axilla.",

          "If both your mammogram and clinical examination are normal, then you need not undergo any other tests. You get the interpretation of your test result, lifestyle interventions and your queries answered. You will have to come again after a fixed time as advised by the breast cancer expert for the next session. You can book the next appointment at your convenience through our app.If you or your clinical examiner feels something abnormal and the mammogram is normal, then you will need to undergo an Ultrasound examination of the breasts to confirm the findings. If anything is still suspicious then you might undergo an Image guided Breast Biopsy to surely rule out cancer.",

      {
        question: "What if my mammogram is abnormal?",
        answer:
          "If your mammogram is abnormal, try not to panic. In most of the cases, an abnormal mammogram turns out not to be breast cancer. But you will need more tests like a more detailed mammogram (3D mammogram), Ultrasound or biopsy to rule out cancer. In some cases, a MRI may be advised if you have very dense breasts. If the suspicion level is low then you might be suggested to have another mammogram in 6 months.",

It was developed by the American College of Radiology and is a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 6 and is used for mammogram, breast ultrasound and Breast MRI. It is a measure of how concerning the finding is. A change in your BIRADS score from test\u002Dto\u002Dtest help more clearly interpret and differentiate any change in your breast tissue.

          " Being a female \u002D This is the main risk factor for breast cancer. Males can also get breast cancer, but it is much more common in females.Getting older \u002D As a person gets older, their risk of breast cancer goes up. Most breast cancers in India are found in the age group of 40\u002D49 years of age.Personal or family history \u002D Someone who has had breast cancer in the past or has a close blood relative who has had breast cancer (mother, father, sister, brother, daughter) has a higher risk of getting it. Having more than one close blood relative increases the risk even more. It’s important to know that most people with breast cancer don’t have a close blood relative with the disease, only 8% of the total diagnosed are Hereditary Breast Cancer.Inherited gene changes \u002DCertain gene changes (most commonly in BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes) can create a higher risk for breast cancer.Starting menstruation early or having late menopause \u002D There may be an increase in risk due to longer exposure to the hormones estrogen and progesterone.Having dense breast tissue \u002D People whose breasts appear dense on mammograms have a higher risk of breast cancer. Dense breast tissue can also make it harder to see cancers on mammograms.Having radiation to the chest \u002D Females who were treated with radiation therapy to the chest, especially as a teen or young adult, have a much higher risk for breast cancer.Some benign breast conditions \u002D Having certain noncancerous breast conditions (e.g., atypia in biopsy from an benign lesion) can increase the risk of getting breast cancer",

This will also include the local spread into the axilla and near the collar bone as well as to distant organs.Other tests that you need to get done are Mammography of Both Breasts\u002D if you don’t have a mammogram already, this helps in knowing if you have any other focus of cancer other than the obvious oneUltrasound of the Breasts \u002D To look for the nature of the swelling, whether it’s a fluid filled cyst or a solid tumorUltrasound Guided Biopsy of the lesion \u002D Biopsy is important in confirming the nature of the tumor. Ultrasound is preferrable while taking the biopsy as it helps in localising the suspicious parts of the lesion.Biopsy \u002D It is where a pathologist looks at the cells of the breast under a microscope to look for cancerous cells and also if these cells are invading the tissue on a microscopic level Immunohistochemistry \u002D It is a diagnostic technique done in laboratory and involves performing special tests on your biopsy tissue sample. It helps in distinguishing the different types and subtypes of the disease. It is important to plan the treatment, chemotherapy and Hormone therapy for the patient.FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) \u002D It is sufficient to establish a diagnosis of breast cancer, but it not preferable over biopsy as the sample obtained is too less to properly characterize the certain features of the cancer.",

          "It is generally performed by either a radiologist or an oncologist. To undergo a biopsy, you will have to undress from waist up and wear a gown. You will be made to lie on a bed and the area to be biopsied will be examined and marked. To clean the area, a small amount of sterilizing agent is applied to make the area sterile and a small incision (2\u002D3mm) is placed over the marked area. Under Image Guidance a special Biopsy Gun is introduced through the incision and is guided to the abnormal area. Upon reaching the area, the gun is fired and the sample is taken. This process of taking the sample is repeated 4\u002D6 times to get an adequate sample for testing.Biopsy is done under local anaesthesia and you will not be sedated. There will be slight discomfort and you can feel the needle but it is not painful.After the procedure, a dressing will be done over the incision and it is not sutured commonly. You will need to stay at the centre for 1\u002D2 hours for observation and you can go home after that.",

Positivity for these receptors indicate that blocking these receptors could stop the growth of these tumors. Since these tumors can be controlled by blocking these receptors using drugs so these tumors are considered to have better potential to get treated. These can also be considered as locks which can be opened using keys (like hormone therapy or other drugs) that can be used to destroy the cancer cells.",

Genetic variants can have harmful, beneficial, neutral (no effect), or unknown or uncertain effects in the risk of developing diseases. Only the harmful variants in these genes are known to be associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. For breast cancers about 8% of cancers are hereditary.Being diagnosed with cancer doesn’t mean that you must get genetic testing done. The decision to get genetic testing depends on your personal and family history.In general, the features that might suggest a hereditary cancer syndrome include: Cancer was diagnosed at an unusually young ageSeveral different types of cancer occurred in the same personCancer in both organs in a set of paired organs, such as both kidneys or both breastsSeveral first\u002Ddegree relatives (the parents, siblings, or children of an individual) have the same type of cancer (for example, a mother, daughter, and sisters with breast cancer); family members with breast or ovarian cancer; family members with colon cancer and endometrial cancerUnusual cases of a specific cancer type (for example, breast cancer in a man)The presence of birth defects that are known to be associated with inherited cancer syndromes, such as certain noncancerous (benign) skin growths and skeletal abnormalities associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.Being a member of a racial or ethnic group that is known to have an increased risk of having a certain inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome and having one or more of the above features as wellSeveral family members with cancer",

          "What are the treatment options available for treatment of breast cancer?",
        answer:
          "<h2>Surgery<h2> \u002DBreast Conservation Surgery \u002D Also referred to a lumpectomy, wide local excision (WLE), quadrantectomy, or partial mastectomy. It is done for small and early breast cancers. A part of the breast along with the tumor is removed in these cases. Surgeon can also get a microscopic examination of the margins of the tumor to ensure that no tumor is left behind. Patients receiving this treatment need to undergo Radiation therapy after the surgery to decrease the chances of cancer coming back in the same breastMastectomy \u002D In this surgery, the whole breast is removed. This can be done for most of the breast cancers which require surgery. For early breast cancers, this can be the only treatment that you need to undergo.Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND) \u002D Axillary Lymph Node Dissection is removal of Lymph Nodes from the axilla on the side of the cancer. This is done in patients who have their lymph nodes involved with cancer.Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) \u002D Sentinel Lymph Node is the first lymph node that drains from the area where cancer is present. In patients who don’t have any of their axillary node involved by cancer in the pre treatment tests, this test is done during the surgery to look whether the cancer has started to involve the axillary nodes. If involved, then the axillary lymph nodes might be removed in some cases.Chemotherapy (Chemo) \u002D Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses powerful chemicals to kill fast\u002Dgrowing cells in your body. Chemotherapy is most often used to treat cancer, since cancer cells grow and multiply much more quickly than most cells in the body. Many different chemotherapy drugs are available. Chemotherapy in breast cancer can be given both before and after the surgery.Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT) \u002D Chemotherapy that is given before surgery is mainly aimed at decreasing the size of the tumor so as to make it operable in case of very large tumors, makes surgical removal easy and it reduces the need for mastectomies.Adjuvant Chemotherapy (ACT) \u002D Whereas the chemotherapy that is given after surgery is aimed at killing any left\u002Dover tumor cells which were not visible on any of the tests and also to kill travelling cells which might be circulating in your blood or lymphatic tissue. These travelling tumor cells are very unlikely to be seen in early breast cancers therefore chemotherapy can be completely avoided in these cases.Radiotherapy \u002D This is a kind of cancer therapy where high doses of radiation is used to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. They damage the genetic material of the cells and thus shrink or reduce the size of these cells. This is given to clear the local site for any residual cells. The type and number of radiotherapies is given based on your general status, radiotherapy received previously and the nature of the cancer.Hormone Therapy \u002D Hormone therapy (also called hormonal therapy, hormone treatment, or endocrine therapy) slows or stops the growth of hormone\u002Dsensitive tumors by blocking the body’s ability to produce hormones or by interfering with effects of hormones on breast cancer cells. Tumors that are hormone insensitive do not have hormone receptors and do not respond to hormone therapy. This can be done in several ways like removing the hormone producing organs, tablets which interfere with hormone production and tablets which interfere with the hormone’s ability to interact with the cancer. These are generally given after surgery but in some cases, it can also be given before surgery in patients with advanced cancer who are not candidates for chemotherapy.Immunotherapy \u002D Immunotherapy is the use of medicines to boost a person’s own immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells more effectively. Immunotherapy works on specific proteins to recognize and destroy cancer cells more effectively. These are very rarely used for breast cancer and is generally used with chemotherapy in triple negative breast cancer.",

Premature menopause (not having any more menstrual periods) and infertility (not being able to become pregnant) may occur and could be permanent.Even if your periods stop while you are on chemo, you may still be able to get pregnant. Getting pregnant while on chemo could lead to birth defects and interfere with treatment. If you have not gone through menopause before treatment and are sexually active, it’s important to discuss using birth control with your doctor.If you think you might want to have children after being treated for breast cancer, talk with your doctor soon after being diagnosed and before you start treatment. You might need to add another drug along with the chemo to help you have a successful pregnancy after the treatment. You can also undergo oocyte preservation before starting the therapy.",

          "Radiation therapy is treatment with high\u002Denergy rays (or particles) that destroy cancer cells. Some women with breast cancer will need radiation, in addition to other treatments.Depending on the breast cancer's stage and other factors, radiation therapy can be used in several situations: After breast\u002Dconserving surgery (BCS), to help lower the chance that the cancer will come back in the same breast or nearby lymph nodes.After a mastectomy, especially if the cancer was larger than 5 cm (about 2 inches), if cancer is found in many lymph nodes, or if certain surgical margins, such as the skin or muscle, have cancer cells.If cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the bones, spinal cord, or brain.Types of Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) \u002D It is the most common type od radiation therapy for women with breast cancer. In this, a machine outside the body focuses the radiation on the area affected by the cancer.If you need EBRT after surgery, it is usually not started until your surgery site has healed, which often takes a month or longer. If you are getting chemotherapy as well, radiation treatments are usually delayed until chemotherapy is done. Some treatments after surgery, like hormone therapy or HER2 targeted therapy, can be given at the same time as radiation.Brachytherapy \u002D Brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation, is another way to deliver radiation therapy. Instead of aiming radiation beams from outside the body, a device containing radioactive seeds or pellets is placed into the breast tissue for a short time in the area where the cancer had been removed (tumor bed). Tumor size, location and other factors may limit who can get brachytherapy.",

The breast cancer cells have receptors (proteins) that attach to estrogen and progesterone, which helps them grow. Treatments that stop these hormones from attaching to these receptors are called hormone or endocrine therapy.Hormone therapy can reach cancer cells almost anywhere in the body and not just in the breast. It's recommended for women with tumors that are hormone receptor\u002Dpositive. It does not help women whose tumors don't have hormone receptors (these tumors are called hormone receptor\u002Dnegative).Hormone therapy is often used after surgery (as adjuvant therapy) to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back. Sometimes it is started before surgery (as neoadjuvant therapy). It is usually taken for at least 5 years. Treatment longer than 5 years might be offered to women whose cancers have a higher chance of coming back.Different drugs used are tamoxifen, toremifene, Fulvestrant, Aromatase Inhibitors, Ovarian Suppression",

        answer:
          "Olaparib (Lynparza) and talazoparib (Talzenna) are drugs known as PARP inhibitors. PARP proteins normally help repair damaged DNA inside cells. The BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) also help repair DNA (in a slightly different way), but mutations in one of those genes can stop this from happening. PARP inhibitors work by blocking the PARP proteins. Because tumor cells with a mutated BRCA gene already have trouble repairing damaged DNA, blocking the PARP proteins often leads to the death of these cells. These drugs are pills and are taken once or twice a day. They can be used in different ways to treat breast cancer. Olaparib can be given to women with a BRCA mutation with early\u002Dstage HER2\u002Dnegative breast cancer after surgery who have been treated with chemotherapy (before or after surgery) and are at high risk of the cancer recurring. It is typically given for one year. When given in this way, it can help some women live longer.Olaparib and talazoparib can be used to treat advanced or metastatic, HER2\u002Dnegative breast cancer in women with a BRCA mutation who have already had chemotherapy.
